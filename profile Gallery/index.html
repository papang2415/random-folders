                    technology called "repulsors" in his boots and gloves. He is not hurt by most weapons like guns and
                    cannons. There are many versions of the Iron Man suit, because Stark keeps making improvements.</p>

                    Quicksilver. She and her brother were once believed to have been Mutant children of Magneto the
                    "Master of Magnetism". She was in truth an orphan who was enhanced by the High Evolutionary at
                    Mount Wundagore becoming a conduit of Chaos Magic allowing her to manipulate probability and warp
                    reality itself. Wanda was trained by Agatha Harkness to become one of the most powerful magic
                    wielders on Earth. She joined the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants fighting for her "father's" cause,
                    alongside her brother, though this was short-lived and she was later recruited into the Avengers,
                    becoming one of their most prominent members alongside her brother.</p>
